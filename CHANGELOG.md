# Changelog

## [1.0.2] - 2026-10-06

Packaging fix - full detection data now bundled for non-editable installs.

### Fixed
- Bundled `data/*.json` and `templates/*.html` into the wheel; non-editable
  installs previously fell back to built-in defaults (6 exploit pattern
  types instead of 12) and lost the HTML report templates

### Changed
- Moved `data/` and `templates/` inside the package
  (`src/pcap_analysis_mcp/`); data paths now resolve package-first with
  fallback to the project root

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-06

Bug fix release - MCP protocol compliance and client compatibility.

### Fixed
- tools/list: added required `inputSchema` to all 63 tools (auto-generated
  from tool signatures); clients previously rejected the entire tool list
- JSON-RPC: notifications (e.g. `notifications/initialized`) no longer
  receive an invalid `id: null` error response
- `generate_html_report` falls back to the embedded template when
  `report_base.html` is missing

### Changed
- initialize: protocolVersion negotiation (2024-11-05 / 2025-03-26 /
  2025-06-18) and `instructions` field
- tools/call: unknown tool / invalid arguments return -32602; execution
  failures return an `isError` result per spec
- stdio: force UTF-8 streams (Windows GBK default), skip malformed lines
  instead of exiting, support JSON-RPC batches, `ping`, and lenient
  `resources/list` / `prompts/list` handling
- CLI: runs as MCP server by default (no arguments needed)
